# AgriConnect – AI-Powered Crop Recommendation & Yield Prediction

AgriConnect is an AI-powered advisory platform for farmers and agricultural officers.  
It uses **ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)** to recommend the most suitable crop based on soil, rainfall, temperature, and other features — and predicts the expected yield.  
It also includes a **rule-based FAQ system** to answer common agricultural queries.
